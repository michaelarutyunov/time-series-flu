# ✅ Configuration Updated Successfully

## What Changed?

### Before (Original)
- **Horizons**: [1, 7, 14, 28] (4 horizons)
- **Origins**: Weekly, 47 weeks
- **Total forecasts per model**: 188
- **TabPFN API calls**: 188

### After (Optimized)
- **Horizons**: [7, 28] (2 horizons)
- **Origins**: Bi-weekly (every 2 weeks), 24 time points
- **Total forecasts per model**: 48
- **TabPFN API calls**: 48

## Impact

### ✅ Benefits
- **74% fewer API calls** (188 → 48)
- **Fits free tier comfortably** (< 50 calls/day)
- **Faster execution** (~30 min vs ~2 hours)
- **Still statistically robust** (24 time points)
- **Better focused** (dropped less useful horizons)

### 📊 What You Keep
- Full seasonal coverage (11 months: Jul 2024 - May 2025)
- Short-term (7-day) and long-term (28-day) comparison
- Adequate sample size for statistical tests
- Perfect for LinkedIn article quality

### ⚠️ What You Lose
- 1-day forecasts (but these are trivial anyway)
- 14-day forecasts (middle ground, less interesting)
- Weekly granularity (now bi-weekly, still adequate)

## Files Updated

1. **nb/02_roll_loop.ipynb** - Cell 10 updated
2. **run_forecasts.py** - Configuration section updated + TabPFN enabled
3. **FORECAST_CONFIG.md** - New documentation file

## How to Run

### Quick Start (without TabPFN)
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
SKIP_TABPFN=1 python run_forecasts.py
```
Expected time: ~8 minutes (SARIMA, LightGBM, Chronos only)

### Full Run (with TabPFN)
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python run_forecasts.py
```
Expected time: ~20-30 minutes (includes 48 TabPFN API calls)

## Output

You'll get 4 parquet files in `results/forecasts/`:
- `sarima_fourier.parquet` (48 forecasts)
- `lightgbm.parquet` (48 forecasts)
- `chronos.parquet` (48 forecasts)
- `tabpfn.parquet` (48 forecasts, if enabled)

Each forecast includes:
- Origin date (when forecast was made)
- Target date (what was predicted)
- Horizon (7 or 28 days)
- Quantiles: q0.1, q0.5, q0.9 (80% prediction interval)
- Actual observed value

## Example Forecast Schedule

The script will make forecasts on these Mondays:

| Week | Date | 7-day Forecast For | 28-day Forecast For |
|------|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | 2024-07-08 | 2024-07-14 | 2024-08-04 |
| 2 | 2024-07-22 | 2024-07-28 | 2024-08-18 |
| 3 | 2024-08-05 | 2024-08-11 | 2024-09-01 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 24 | 2025-05-26 | 2025-06-01 | 2025-06-22* |

*Note: Some 28-day forecasts may extend slightly beyond available data (2025-06-15)

## Next Steps

After running forecasts:
1. Check `results/forecasts/` for parquet files
2. Run `03_evaluation.ipynb` to calculate metrics
3. Compare model performance by horizon
4. Generate visualizations for LinkedIn article
